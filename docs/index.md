**DePub is an open-source tool aimed particularly at the publishing industry.**

The aim of this project is to develop highly effective and cost-saving tool that will allow anyone - and particularly those with editorial judgement - efficiently to extract sample material for use in the marketing and promotion of books.

## Features

* Direct extraction of text and cover images from EPUBs.
* Processing of Markdown, DOCX, RTF, DocBook and LaTeX files.
* Batch processing of folders full of data.
* Intelligent assisted selection of the start point for reading.
* Automatic extraction of required sample size, rounded to the nearest paragraph.

## Using DePub

DePub has been developed in [LiveCode](https://www.livecode.com), an excellent open-source rapid application development tool. This provides a really nice working UI along with high-speed processing of data.

You can download either a pre-compiled OS X or Windows application, or download the .livecode file and compile it yourself.

## Development

The initial aim of this project is to develop DePub to the point where it can be released as a "version 1" application.

A longer-term goal is to produce an additional web-based tool to allow such things social crowdsourcing of sample selection.

Note that DePub is released under a GPL licence, so all development work should be contributed back to the project. Your hard work will be greatly appreciated!
