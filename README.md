# DePub

A [LiveCode](https://www.livecode.com) application to extract samples of text from EPUBs and other sources.

Compiled files are available for Mac OS X and Windows. Simply download and install.

The .livecode file was last edited in LiveCode 8.1.6, though it will probably work fine with any 8.x version.
